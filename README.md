#Sentient Appliances 
# by Courtney Crother


###Sentient Appliances is a new speculative technology and game. As the user you are given a series of options on how to use your new techonology. 

###It took me a while to figure out the buttons. But I am very happy with out it turned out! I used the CSV files to make the paths for the rooms. There are five endings and muiltiple ways to go through. 

### Here is the link to my XD file

### The source code comes from the speculative design project, although I took out a lot and changed it to work for my project. The repository has the sketch.js code, p5.2dadventure.js, p5.clickable.js, and p5.play.js files.

### I updated my charaters page and the button stopped working! Cant figure it out, but it worked before.
